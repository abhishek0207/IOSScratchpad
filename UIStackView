A stack view is nothing but adding a wrapper on top of auto layout. Hence it automatically adds constraints for the subviews. The stack view manages the layout of all the views in its arrangedSubviews property. 
Hence with stack view we don't have to worry about auto layout constraints as it automatically generates them for us.

Can be horizontal or vertical stack views.

UIStackView.Distribution : The distribution determines how the stack view lays out its arranged views along its axis. There are five options for UIStackViews : 

* fill (default) -> give whatever space the element needs
* fillEqually
* fillProportionally
* equalSpacing
* equalCentering

UIStackView.Alignment : This property determines how the stack view lays out its views in the direction perpendicular to its axis.

* fill (default)
* leading / top
* trailing / bottom
* center
* firstBaseline / lastBaseline
